# 📡 Communication Protocols Simulator – C++ (OOP)

A C++ project focused on modeling communication protocols using object-oriented programming.

## 📌 Overview

The goal of this project was to practice core OOP concepts by designing a system that represents communication protocols as classes. The structure is based on inheritance and virtual methods to model shared behavior and extensions.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- Class hierarchy representing protocol components  
- Use of inheritance and virtual methods  
- Operator overloading  
- Modular and structured C++ code  

## 🧩 Purpose

Academic project created to develop practical understanding of object-oriented programming and system modeling in C++.

## 🧰 Technologies

- C++  
- OOP (inheritance, virtual functions, operator overloading)
